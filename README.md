# Arduino_Pong
Pong for an Arduino Uno on a SSD1306 display.

This is a quick project for me learn Platform IO with Visual Studio Code.

The paddles are controlled by a potentiameter connected to the analog to digital converter for each player. Additionally, each player has a button to serve the ball.

Game is displayed on a 128x64 monochrome OLED display using the SSD1306 display driver. I believe it is configured for operation in I2C mode. However, the labels on the chip are vague.
